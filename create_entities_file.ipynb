These molluscs are also sometimes commonly known as sea cradles or \"coat-of-mail shells\". They are also sometimes referred to more formally as loricates, polyplacophorans, and rarely as polyplacophores. Chitons have a dorsal shell which is composed of eight separate shell plates or valves. These plates overlap somewhat at the front and back edges, and yet the plates articulate well with one another.\n",
