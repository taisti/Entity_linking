The black crappie has 7-8 spines on its dorsal fin. The number of spines on the dorsal fin, is occasionally the only way to differeniate between a juvenile black crappie and a white crappie. The black crappie tends to prefer clearer water than the white crappie does. Its native range is uncertain, since it has been so widely transplanted, but it is presumed to be similar to the white crappie's. The black crappie is also known as the strawberry bass or Oswego bass. ("

The Roe Deer is a relatively small deer, with a body length of 95-135 cm, a shoulder height of 65-75 cm, and a weight of 15-30 kg. It has rather short, erect antlers and a reddish body with a grey face. Its hide is golden red in summer, darkening to brown or even black in winter, with lighter undersides and a white rump patch; the tail is very short (2-3 cm), and barely visible. Only the males have antlers, which are lost during winter, but which re-grow in time for the mating season."

The two species met at the Caucasus Mountains, with the European species occupying the southern flank of the mountain ranges and adjacent Asia Minor and the Siberian species occupying the northern flank of the mountain ranges. Within Europe, the European Roe Deer occurs in most areas, with the exception of northern Scandinavia and some of the islands, notably Iceland, Ireland, and the Mediterranean Sea islands; in the Mediterranean region it is largely confined to mountainous regions, and is absent or rare at low levels. The Roe Deer is a relatively small deer, with a body length of 95-135 cm, a shoulder height of 65-75 cm, and a weight of 15-30 kg. It has rather short, erect antlers and a reddish body with a grey face. Its hide is golden red in summer, darkening to brown or even black in winter, with lighter undersides and a white rump patch; the tail is very short (2-3 cm), and barely visible. Only the males have antlers, which are lost during winter, but which re-grow in time for the mating season."

J√≠cama is a species in the genus Pachyrhizus in the bean family (Fabaceae). Plants in this genus are commonly referred to as yam bean, although the term ""yam bean"" can be another name for j√≠cama.

In contrast to the root, the remainder of the j√≠cama plant is very poisonous; the seeds contain the toxin rotenone, which is used to poison insects and fish.

Salmon are capable of going hundreds of kilometers upriver, and humans must install fish ladders in dams to enable the salmon to get past. Catadromous fish live in fresh water, breed in the sea; the most remarkable are freshwater eels of genus Anguilla, whose larvae drift on the open ocean, sometimes for months or years, before travelling thousands of kilometres back to their original streams. Amphidromous fish move between fresh and salt water during some part of life cycle, but not for breeding."

In a late stage of cheese production, the Propionibacter consumes the lactic acid excreted by the other bacteria, and releases carbon dioxide gas, which slowly forms the bubbles that develop the eyes.

Most crayfish cannot tolerate polluted water, although some species such as the invasive *Procambarus clarkii* are more hardy. Some crayfish have been found living as much as 3 m (10 feet) underground.

There are three families of crayfish, two in the Northern Hemisphere and one in the Southern Hemisphere. The Southern Hemisphere family *Parastacidae* lives in South America, Madagascar and Australasia, and is distinguished by the lack of the first pair of pleopods. Of the other two families, members of the *Astacidae* live in western Eurasia and western North America and members of the family *Cambaridae* live in eastern Asia and eastern North America.
