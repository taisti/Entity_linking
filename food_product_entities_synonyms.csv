The black crappie has 7-8 spines on its dorsal fin. The number of spines on the dorsal fin, is occasionally the only way to differeniate between a juvenile black crappie and a white crappie. The black crappie tends to prefer clearer water than the white crappie does. Its native range is uncertain, since it has been so widely transplanted, but it is presumed to be similar to the white crappie's. The black crappie is also known as the strawberry bass or Oswego bass. ("

Jícama is a species in the genus Pachyrhizus in the bean family (Fabaceae). Plants in this genus are commonly referred to as yam bean, although the term ""yam bean"" can be another name for jícama.

In contrast to the root, the remainder of the jícama plant is very poisonous; the seeds contain the toxin rotenone, which is used to poison insects and fish.

FAO: The yam bean is a legume but unlike its close relatives the soybean and other beans, the yam bean is cultivated for its large, tuberous roots."

Salmon are capable of going hundreds of kilometers upriver, and humans must install fish ladders in dams to enable the salmon to get past. Catadromous fish live in fresh water, breed in the sea; the most remarkable are freshwater eels of genus Anguilla, whose larvae drift on the open ocean, sometimes for months or years, before travelling thousands of kilometres back to their original streams. Amphidromous fish move between fresh and salt water during some part of life cycle, but not for breeding."

Cakes normally combine some kind of flour, a sweetening agent (commonly sugar), a binding agent (generally egg, though gluten  or starch  are often used by lacto-vegetarians and vegans), fats (usually butter, shortening, or margarine, although a fruit puree such as applesauce is sometimes substituted to avoid using fat), a liquid (milk, water or fruit juice), flavors and some form of leavening agent (such as yeast or baking powder), though many cakes lack these ingredients and instead rely on air bubbles in the dough to expand and cause the cake to rise. Cake is often frosted with buttercream  or marzipan, and finished with piped borders and crystallized fruit."

In a late stage of cheese production, the Propionibacter consumes the lactic acid excreted by the other bacteria, and releases carbon dioxide gas, which slowly forms the bubbles that develop the eyes.
