8 potatoes (small floury, such a Maris Pipers)
6 rashers (streaky bacon)
2 tablespoons milk (double/heavy cream whole, is ok if you haven't got any cream)
2 tablespoons butter
1 pinch salt (and pepper)
175 grams cheese (your favourite, I used a mix of 75% mature chedder and 25% red Leicester, grated)
4 spring onions (/scallions chopped)
