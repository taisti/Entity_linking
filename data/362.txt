8 ounces dough (Pillsbury crescent roll, I like to use the Crescent Dough Sheets, which donâ€™t have any perforations)
1 pound extra lean ground beef (can substitute with ground turkey or chicken as well)
1 cup salsa (can substitute with barbecue sauce)
1 cup grated cheddar cheese (I used 2% cheese, but any variety will work)
sliced green onions (Optional garnish:)
