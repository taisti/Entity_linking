3 cups flour (sifted, cake or pastry flour works best since they’re softer)
4 tablespoons sugar (depending on how sweet you want it – or omit it all together)
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup raisins (leave these out for a more traditional soda bread)
1 1/3 cups buttermilk
